    2. To deploy to gh pages:

    Just follow these simple steps:

1. Install the gh-pages package (ctrl+~ to open the terminal in VS Code)
npm install gh-pages --save-dev   [or similar yarn commands]
2. In the package.json file add these lines before "build": "vite build",

"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",

3. In the vite.config.js file add this line before plugins: [react()],
base: "/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME",

Change YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME to the name of your GitHub repository.

4. In terminal type
npm run deploy or yarn deploy
ðŸŽ‰ You now have a gh-pages branch in your repository and your app is deployed (you can check it under Settings -> Pages )
It took a while for the deployed app to appear in the settings.

P.S. To update your app deployment, just run the npm run deploy or yarn deploy command again.
